				<p>
					The Promise in the above example is eager, since the callback function provided to a Promise
					constructor function is executed immediatelly. If you execute the code, you will see that the
					message from within the Promise is displayed before calling a then method on the Promise object. On
					the contrary, an Observable is lazy.
				</p>

				<p>
					If you create an Observable, you provide a callback function that will be called upon invoking
					subscribe method on the Observable object. As you can see, the message ‘Before calling subscribe…’
					will appear before the console.log from within the Observable.
				</p>

				<p>
					You may compare the above examples to a situation in which you arrive at the hotel and you see a
					greeting poster (Promise-already prepared and available to read by calling then method), whereas an
					Observable is a greeting lady who greets each new guest when he arrives (calling subscribe method on
					an Observable).
